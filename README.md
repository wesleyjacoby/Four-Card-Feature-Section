## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I am starting to get more comfortable with CSS Grid. Especially with using the `grid-template-areas` and `grid-area` properties and how to use them to make the grid responsive.

I am also getting much more comfortable developing for mobile first.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing these sorts of challenges where they look more like sections of the website instead of a component of a website. These offer more of a challenge when it comes to positioning elements on the page.
